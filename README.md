# TotoApp 
  This app is intended to those who like to follow blogs, news websites, pretty much everything with support for rss. They can have all the data structured as they please and access it in a more simple and less time consuming manor, than accessing every website one by one. 
The app will allow the user, to add a feed or create his on personalized feeds by combining different websites posts into one feed, and categorize them as he wishes. 

  This is a Android rss feed reader application, made to support mobile devices with Android 4.0.3 to the latest one, at the moment of creating this readme, 5.0. At this point, the app is in a crude, unfinished state, allowing anyone who uses it to add a feed, and access the posts provided. The feed url has to be exactly the one on wich the feed is shown (example: http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss). All added feeds can be seen by swapping to the right, or tapping the upper left shown name. The posts show up as the title of the post to wich it points to. By tapping it the app will open the phones browser and show the content on the targeted website.
